# Clustering-Pipeline

This is complete pipeline for clustering problems.
This Pipeline is divided 5 parts.
  1) Data loading and initial field analysis.
  2) Scaling data with  scaling techniques.
  3) Dimensionality Reduction.
  4) Finding optimal no. of clusters.
  5) Clustering Algorithms.
  6) Visualisation of clusters.
  7) Performance matrix for clustering results to measure the accuracy of model experimentation.
I have added 4 types of Clustering algorithms
  1) K-Means
  2) Agglomerative clustering
  3) DB-SCAN Clustering
  4) GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)
 
This pipeline is completely reusable. I have used Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
